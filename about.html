  <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>
      I am working toward being a relator because I enjoy looking at houses and helping people. I want to have a job that I enjoy and not one that I feel forced to do. In the past, I've gotten told to do things that I didn't enjoy and that led me to not do my best on it. I'm working toward these goals by continuing focusing on school and working harder everyday. I want to be more social with people and I want to continue to get to where I need to be on time and prepared. The values I consider most necessary for my success are to be social, hard-working, focused, educated, and honest. A short-term goal I hope to accomplish in the near future would be getting into a great college where I can play volleyball. I think to achieve this I have to begin working harder now, and begin to focus on what I'm doing. Another thing is to be ready physically, mentally, and financially. The character traits and achievements I most want to be known for is being ambitious, selfless, persistent, charitable. I think that these traits are really important to have because it'll help more people know that they can come to me for whatever and whenever.
